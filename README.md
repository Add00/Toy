The Toy programming language is a procedural bytecode-intermediate interpreted language. It isn't intended to operate on it's own, but rather as part of another program, the "host". This process is intended to allow a decent amount of easy customisation by the host's end user, by exposing logic in script files. Alternatively, binary files in a custom format can be used as well.

The host will provide all of the extensions needed on a case-by-case basis. Script files have the `.toy` file extension, while binary files have the `.tb` file extension.

# Nifty Features

* Simple C-like syntax
* Bytecode intermediate compilation
* `import` and `export` variables from the host program
* Optional, but robust type system
* functions and types are first-class citizens
* Fancy slice notation for strings, arrays and dictionaries
