# Roadmapping Toy

## Game And Game Engine

The Toy programming langauge was designed from the beginning as though it was supposed to be embedded into an imaginary game engine. Development on said engine and an associated game have proceeded smoothly so far.

## Microprocessor Support

A fork of the language intended to run on microprocessors is currently under development by 3rd parties. Support and advice will be provided to them where needed.

## Nice To Have Features

Potential future additions include:

* A threading library
* A timer library
* More random generation libraries (numbers, perlin noise, wave function collapse?)
* Multiple return values from functions
* Interpolated strings

Some of these have always been planned, but were sidelined or are incomplete for one reason or another.

## Nope Features

Some things which simply will not be added in the foreseeable future are:

* Classes & Structures
* Do-while loops
