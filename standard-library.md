# Standard Library

The standard library offers a number of miscellaneous utility functions, which can be used for various purposes. These functions are implemented by the host program, so they may not all be provided by default.

The standard library can usually be accessed with the `import` keyword:

```
import standard;
```

## fn clock(): string

This function returns the current timestamp.
